<p>Life is going well</p><p>In the past year I haven’t posted much outside of race
reports. It is a combination of reasons, mainly that I have been extremely
pressed for time, and that my attitude toward racing was pretty crappy (if you
don’t have anything nice to say…). Both of those factors have changed this
year, and now I want to brag about how exciting my life has been and how much I
love racing triathlons again.</p><p>Training this year has been really fun. I graduate from
Chicago Booth in June, but having finished my graduation requirements I’m
really just enjoying training like a professional triathlete again. For most of
January and February I stayed with my in-laws in Pasadena, training in the
mountains North of LA. I’ve been swimming outdoors at the Rose Bowl, cycling
into the Angels National Forest and running trails all around the area. It’s
the most fun I’ve had training in a long time, and it’s really changed my
mindset with regard to triathlon.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, a year ago I would have questioned
whether I would still be racing at this point. I was getting sick of doing the
same races against the same people. The funding for pro triathletes has
squeezed as well due mainly to the consolidation of Ironman races and the end
of other pro series like Lifetime Fitness and 5150. I was also working at SRAM
for my MBA internship and really enjoying it.</p><p>I decided I would give it one more go, but with a different
philosophy. I would take advantage of a more flexible schedule and plan my
season around potential fun, rather than potential earnings. I figured there
was no reason to go to a race with $100,000 in prize money, if the course
wasn’t suited to me. I wouldn’t enjoy the race, and even if I maximized my
earnings, I’m still making less than a typical Booth graduate – and many of
those jobs would be more fun that risking another heat stroke in 90% humidity
in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>So this year’s schedule is all about having fun. I went to
Pucon because it’s touted as one of the most beautiful triathlons in the world
(it is), and I stayed for a few days to go mountain biking, and enjoy the area.
I raced in Israel because it’s a country I really wanted to visit, and because
Abby was able to travel with me. And I raced in Buenos Aires because I love
Argentina and I wanted to spend a few days touring the city (after the race, of
course). Next month I’ll do Ironman South Africa and then I’ll spend 10 days
traveling with Abby. Finally, I’m racing with Aaron Scheidies, trying to
qualify for the Paralympics for cycling because I enjoy being part of a team
and because I want Aaron to be able to achieve his dreams.</p><p>It’s may not be the most lucrative plan, but then again, the
past few years, as I’ve planned my season to maximize income and pay my tuition
bills to University of Chicago, I lost track of why I started racing triathlons
in the first place. I joined Volcano Triathlon Team in 2006 because I wanted to
meet people and challenge myself in a new sport. I quit my job to focus on
triathlon because I wanted to see if I had what it took to make the Olympics,
and I kept racing after 2012 because I still loved how exhilarating it is to
pour your energy into a singular goal and then test yourself against the
world’s best.</p><p>Somewhere, perhaps in my indoor trainer hours at 5am, I lost
the feeling of fun that went along with those goals. Triathlon started to feel
like a job, a means to an end that failed to surprise.</p><p>I kept it up because I love the sport, and I was still
racing well – better than ever even. I kept it up because Aaron asked me to
help him and I felt like I had a greater purpose than “playing bikes” (which is
what Abby jokingly calls my job). I kept it up to prove to myself that I could.</p><p>This year, life is a little easier. “Playing bikes” has led
to two wins and a third in the first quarter of the year. It’s led to a lot of
smiles and self-reflection and new friends. In California I pushed myself to
the brink of overtraining, just by having fun. In Chicago I’m making the most
of what I have, and the training there isn’t so bad when I have a race calendar
that I’m actually looking forward to again.</p><p>So far, this year is going well.</p><p>Photos copyright <a href="edlphotography.com">Elizabeth Leitzell</a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><picture>
